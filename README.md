# ClickerJavaGUI
A simple Java GUI that counts and store the amount of clicks. Brings up Pop-ups, and also shows a small animation of a moving .png at the end. 

Originally made by me (Juan Jimenez 'JuanJimene') for a clas project to learn the basics of GUI in Java. Used mostly JAVA Swing for the main purposes of the GUI, which was to play a clicking minigame where the game interacts with the user in a fun way. 

IMPORTANT: To start the game, run Project4GUI.java inside the src/ folder.
